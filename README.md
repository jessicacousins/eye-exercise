**Description:** \*The container element is where the smiley face and eyes are displayed. The smiley face is an image file that is positioned using CSS with a box-shadow and border-radius applied. The eyes are implemented using two nested divs, with one div acting as the eye and the other as the pupil (or ball). Both eyes are placed in a div with the class "eyes," which is centered on the page using the "transform" property.

The footer contains two links, one that points to the landing page and another that links to the author's GitHub page. These links are styled using CSS and have hover effects.

The JavaScript code creates an event listener that listens for mouse movements. When the mouse moves, the code calculates the position of the mouse pointer and updates the position of the pupils accordingly. The pupils move based on the percentage of the mouse's position relative to the width and height of the viewport.\*

**Roadmap of future improvements:** The code will be edited as new skills develop to have the page become more dynamic and responsive with viewports.
